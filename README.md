# C_Stack_Array
A stack data structure which implemented with array in C language
This has create stack, Push and Pop functions as a main function to this Data Structure.
I have used a helper function like isEmpty, isFull and PrintStack which make the code more readable and easy in implemenation.
I've tests the code with these functions -simple test- in the main functoin.
This Data Structure is implemented with Array :)
